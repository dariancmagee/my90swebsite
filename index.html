        <h1>JOURNEY INTO MARVEL</h1>
        <p>You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time.  Alright. So... five years ago, right before <a href="https://www.marvel.com">Thanos</a>, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.  No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.  Look...It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition. </p>
